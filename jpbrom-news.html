<h1>jpbROM 13.2 new features, rumors and other developments!</h1>
<p>There have been rumors that jpbROM 13.2 will FINALLY include AppGet, as well as USP (Unified ScratchTappy Platform) and some other new apps. It is also scheduled to add builds for new devices (Pixel 5, Pixel 5a, POCO X3 NFC), as well as bringing jpbROM up to date by integrating Android 13 QPR3. This detail alone means that jpbROM 13.2 will be released a few days after Android 13 QPR3, which makes the release date shift to Mid-June, as QPR3 is expected to be released in early June. Because of this, jpbROM 13.1 is still in active development and has received numerous updates since its initial release on April 5 of this year. The same is predicted to happen to jpbROM 13.2 after it goes public.<br>I have detailed that jpbROM will become open source soon, and jpbROM 13.2 may be the first release to be fully open source. Additionally, jpbROM Core 11, an Android 11-styled version of jpbROM 13 is scheduled to launch to the public alongside jpbROM 13.2, as it is in active development right now (as of the time of writing), though it could always launch based on jpbROM 13.1, as I have said in my YT Community Tab, the first build of jpbROM Core will be 13.1.1.0.TDVCRMI, which makes the rumour that jpbROM Core will launch with jpbROM 13.1 instead of 13.2 a bit more believable. Well, nothing will be certain than until I release jpbROM Core to the public...
